# Build Viewer
This modification displays the upgrades and captain skills of the player's ship.

If you are an observer in the training room, it shows the composition of the ship at the center of the screen.  
You can simply aim at a player and no other input or lock-on is required.

The mod element can be drag&dropped. You can also click on the arrow to hide/show this viewer.

# Requirements
You must install the following for this mod to work:
- [DraggableUnbound2](../../../DraggableUnbound2)

# Install
1. Download a zip.
2. Unzip the archive and you should get `gui`, `PnFMods` folders, and `PnFModsLoader.py`.
3. Move them to `(wows)/bin/(latest_number)/res_mods/`. So the path will look like `res_mods/PnFModsLoader.py`, etc.
4. Done!
